## About the Data

### How is the data collected?

The America's Pulse Survey is collected online each week. It consists of a series of [core questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GR4YjbJ5TEZLlHLsJigph677lRc-dodM/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=100469505346687216493&rtpof=true&sd=true) intended to assess partisan animosity in the American context.

In addition to our core questions, our weekly survey often includes sets of questions designed by other political science researchers who apply for survey time on our panel (see our [Request for Proposals](https://polarizationresearchlab.org/request-for-proposals)) [^1].

[^1]: RFP questions always appear _after_ our core questions.

### Who are the respondents?

The respondants are paid survey takers from the [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/) survey platform.

You can find the list of demographic variables we collect [at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWUaK-tizXXpVbGQGDeLPFCCsS1c1JII/view?usp=share_link).

## About the Dashboard

### Who made this?

This dashboard was designed by the Polarization Research Lab [faculty and staff](https://polarizationresearchlab.org/team/).

### What tools are you using?

The layout of this dashboard is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) -- leveraging a mildly-edited version of the [Chirpy Theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).

The plots are built using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), plus a number of very useful Chart.js plugins. Namely:

- [chart-js-geo](https://github.com/sgratzl/chartjs-chart-geo)
- [chart-js-annotations](https://www.chartjs.org/chartjs-plugin-annotation/latest/)
- [chart-js-sankey](https://github.com/kurkle/chartjs-chart-sankey)

The gauge visualizations leverage the [gauge.js library](https://bernii.github.io/gauge.js/).

### Where's the code?

The code can be found on the [Polarization Research Lab Github page](https://github.com/Polarization-Research-Lab).
