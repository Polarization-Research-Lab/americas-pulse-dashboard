Since we began collecting data in September (2022), we've made a few design changes for various reasons (decreasing the survey time, methodological improvements, etc). The changes are listed below:


- 2022 week 41: Changed from sampling a subset of norm violation / perception pairs and policy questions to show all to all respondents.
- 2022 week 51: To reduce survey time, randomly sample 5 policy questions per respondent, and randomly sample 3 of the norm perception items.
- 2023 week 18: Added norm_companies and norm_companies_perception questions.
- 2023 week 24: Added an additional attention check at the beginning of the survey.
